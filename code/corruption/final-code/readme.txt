Note: These are the latest codes (02-14-2025). 


User experimentation and reproduction of paper's results:

- ALG_experiments.m allows the user to input different parameters, run QTRK (or mQTRK) over multiple trials and generate plots 


Algorithms Implementation:

- QTRK_Algorithm.m is the implementations of QTRK in the paper
- mQTRK_Algorithm.m are the implementations of mQTRK in the paper


Supporting Functions:

- ALG_trials.m runs QTRK (or mQTRK) over multiple trials

- ALG_plots.m generates error plots for (QTRK or mQTRK) after running ALG_trials.m


Comparison of Algorithms and reproduction of paper's results:

- mQTRK_QTRK_experiments.m allows the user to input different parameters, run QTRK and mQTRK over multiple trials, and generate plots

- mQTRK_QTRK_trials.m runs QTRK and mQTRK (on the same problem) over multiple trials

- mQTRK_QTRK_plots.m plots generates error plots for QTRK and mQTRK after running mQTRK_QTRK_trials.m
